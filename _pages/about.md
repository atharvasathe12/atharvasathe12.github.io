My [research](https://atharvasathe12.github.io/research/) aims to deepen our understanding of roughness-induced secondary flows, ultimately enhancing our ability to predict and model the atmospheric boundary layer.
For these investigations, I use Large Eddy Simulations to model turbulent flows over both resolved obstacles and parameterized roughness elements.


I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University, advised by [Prof. Marco G. Giometto](https://www.civil.columbia.edu/content/marco-giovanni-giometto), and will defend my dissertation in December 2025.
I also closely collaborate with [Prof. Marc Calaf](https://www.mech.utah.edu/directory/faculty/marc-calaf/) and [Prof. William Anderson](https://me.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/william-anderson/).
Following my Ph.D., I will join Johns Hopkins University as a Postdoctoral Fellow, where I will work with Profs. [Charles Meneveau](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/charles-meneveau/), [Julie Lundquist](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/julie-lundquist/), and [Dennice Gayme](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/dennice-gayme/) to develop and conduct high-fidelity simulations of offshore wind farms.
Previously, I earned a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Technology in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Bombay.
