## Reversal of mean and instantaneous secondary flow structures in multi-column roughness configurations
**Advisor: [Prof. Marco G. Giometto](https://www.civil.columbia.edu/content/marco-giovanni-giometto)**, **Collaborators: [Prof. William Anderson](https://me.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/william-anderson/), [Prof. Marc Calaf](https://www.mech.utah.edu/directory/faculty/marc-calaf/)**

**Publication status: Manuscript is currently under preparation for consideration in *JFM*.**

**Overview**:

This research seeks to examine the parameters of roughness configurations that are crucial in determining the alignment of high- and low-momentum pathways induced by secondary flows. 
Since the alignment of these pathways significantly influences performance-critical quantities such as drag and heat transfer, identifying these parameters is essential to improving our predictive capabilities.


**Highlights**:

1. Discovered that gap between roughness elements of neighboring columns is a crucial parameter which dictates the alignment of aforementioned pathways, a parameter previously unknown in the literature.
2. Demonstrated that the strength of secondary flows is not diminished in intermediate configurations. In these configurations, the secondary flows undergo frequent, instantaneous rearrangements, which results in a misleading appearance of their destruction in long-time averaged flow fields.
